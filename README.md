# 🎓 Madrasati Reliability Demo

This is a **simple Java sample project** that simulates some basic features of the *Madrasati* education platform:

- 👤 Student registration  
- 📚 Attendance tracking  
- 📝 Homework submission  
- 📊 Grade recording  

---

## ✨ Purpose
The goal is to provide a **lightweight demo** that shows how reliability and fault tolerance concepts can be applied in a simple way, such as:

- 🔄 Retries with backoff  
- ⚡ Circuit breaker pattern  
- ⏱️ Timeout handling  
- 🛡️ Idempotency (avoid duplicates)  
- 📥 Fallback queue for failed requests

## 📌 Note
This is **just a sample project for educational purposes** and a prototype for demonstration only.  
It is **not production-ready**.
